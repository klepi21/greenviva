# GreenViva Email Tracker

## Background and Motivation
The project aims to create a mobile-optimized web application that tracks and analyzes money transfer emails from viva.com. The application will help users monitor their daily earnings and track historical data. Key features include Google authentication for secure access to emails, automated parsing of transfer notifications, and a goal-tracking system.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Email Integration
   - Need to implement Google OAuth for secure email access
   - Must filter emails specifically from no-reply@viva.com
   - Need to parse email content to extract transfer amounts
   
2. Data Processing
   - Extract and store key information: date, amount, sender
   - Calculate daily totals
   - Track progress against daily goals
   
3. User Interface
   - Mobile-first design approach
   - Simple, intuitive interface
   - Real-time goal progress visualization
   - Historical data view with date selection

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and required dependencies
   - Success Criteria: Project runs without errors and has all necessary dependencies
   
2. Implement Google OAuth authentication
   - Set up Google Cloud project and obtain credentials
   - Implement login/logout functionality
   - Success Criteria: Users can successfully log in with their Google account

### Phase 2: Email Integration
3. Implement Gmail API integration
   - Set up Gmail API access
   - Create email fetching service
   - Success Criteria: Application can successfully fetch emails from the user's Gmail account

4. Implement email filtering and parsing
   - Filter emails from no-reply@viva.com
   - Parse email content to extract transfer amounts
   - Success Criteria: System correctly identifies and parses transfer amounts from viva.com emails

### Phase 3: User Interface Development
5. Create mobile-optimized layout
   - Implement responsive design
   - Create navigation structure
   - Success Criteria: Application is fully functional on mobile devices

6. Implement Today's Overview page
   - Display today's total earnings
   - Show progress towards daily goal
   - Success Criteria: Users can see their daily progress and goal status

7. Implement Historical Data page
   - Create date selector
   - Display historical email data
   - Success Criteria: Users can view and analyze past transfer data

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Core functionality implementation is complete. Next steps:
1. Need Google Cloud client secret to complete OAuth setup
2. Once authentication is working, we can test:
   - Email fetching
   - Transfer parsing
   - Goal tracking
   - Historical data viewing

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
To complete the implementation, I need:
1. Google Cloud client secret to be added to .env.local along with the existing client ID

## Lessons
- Gmail API requires specific scopes for email access
- Email parsing needs to be robust to handle various email formats
- Mobile-first design improves overall user experience
